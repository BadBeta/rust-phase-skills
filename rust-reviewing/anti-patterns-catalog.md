# Part A — Named Anti-Patterns to Flag in Review

## OO-Mimicry Anti-Patterns

These five anti-patterns are the most common attempts to write
Java/C++/Python-style code in Rust. Each compiles (or nearly compiles)
but produces designs that fight the language. The references point at
the canonical guidance — Rust API Guidelines and rust-unofficial/patterns.

### A1. `Deref` used to fake inheritance

**Flag if you see**: `impl Deref for Outer { type Target = Inner; ... }`
where `Inner` is *not* a smart-pointer pointee — i.e., `Outer` doesn't
*contain a pointer to* `Inner`, it just wraps it for code reuse.

**BAD**:

```rust
struct Logger { inner: ConnectionPool }
impl Deref for Logger {
    type Target = ConnectionPool;
    fn deref(&self) -> &ConnectionPool { &self.inner }
}
// Caller writes logger.acquire(), surprised that all of ConnectionPool's
// future API is also exposed on Logger.
```

**GOOD** — explicit forwarding:

```rust
impl Logger {
    pub fn acquire(&self) -> Acquired<'_> {
        // explicit method that decides what to expose
        self.inner.acquire()
    }
}
```

**Why bad**:

- `Deref` was designed for smart pointers (`Box`, `Rc`, `Arc`); using
  it for code reuse violates the invariant readers assume.
- Adding any method to `Inner` automatically adds it to `Outer`'s
  public API with no compile-time review.
- `self` semantics differ from OO inheritance — see references below.

**Severity**: request-change. Rarely a correctness bug; always a
maintenance bug.

**References**:

- [Rust API Guidelines, C-DEREF](https://rust-lang.github.io/api-guidelines/predictability.html):
  *"Only smart pointers should implement `Deref` and `DerefMut`
  traits, as the compiler's implicit rules for these traits are
  specifically designed for smart pointer use cases."*
- [rust-unofficial/patterns *Deref Polymorphism*](https://rust-unofficial.github.io/patterns/anti_patterns/deref.html):
  *"This pattern does not introduce subtyping ... traits implemented
  by `Foo` are not automatically implemented for `Bar`. Furthermore,
  [it] interacts badly with bounds checking and thus generic
  programming."*
- [rust-clippy issue #2301](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-clippy/issues/2301)
  — open lint proposal acknowledging community consensus.

### A2. Generic type used as a "base class" replacement

**Flag if you see**: code attempting to put `Container<TypeA>` and
`Container<TypeB>` into the same `Vec` or pass them through the same
trait-object boundary.

**BAD**:

```rust
struct Job<P: Plugin> { plugin: P }
let jobs: Vec<Job<_>> = vec![Job::new(PluginA), Job::new(PluginB)];
// E0308: expected `Job<PluginA>`, found `Job<PluginB>`
```

**GOOD** — enum (closed set) or `Box<dyn Trait>` (open set):

```rust
// Closed set: enum
enum Job { A(JobA), B(JobB) }
let jobs: Vec<Job> = vec![Job::A(JobA), Job::B(JobB)];

// Open set: trait objects
let jobs: Vec<Box<dyn Plugin>> = vec![Box::new(PluginA), Box::new(PluginB)];
```

**Why bad**: each `Container<T>` is a distinct concrete type via
monomorphization. There is no runtime "generic Container" type. The
attempt reveals an OO inheritance hierarchy mistakenly imported into
Rust.

**Severity**: request-change to redesign.

**References**:

- [Rust Reference, Generics](https://doc.rust-lang.org/reference/items/generics.html)
  — monomorphization mechanics.
- [rust-unofficial/patterns *Generics as Type Classes*](https://rust-unofficial.github.io/patterns/functional/generics-type-classes.html):
  *"`Vec<isize>` and `Vec<char>` are two different types, which are
  recognized as distinct by all parts of the type system."*

### A3. Stringly-typed enum constructor

**Flag if you see**: `fn new(kind: String, ...) -> Self { match kind.as_str() { ... } }`
or any constructor where a string parameter selects one of several
typed variants.

**BAD**:

```rust
impl Operation {
    pub fn new(kind: String, lhs: Operand, rhs: Operand) -> Self {
        match kind.as_str() {
            "add" => Self::Addition { lhs, rhs },
            "sub" => Self::Addition { lhs, rhs },  // BUG: should be Subtraction
            _ => panic!(),
        }
    }
}
```

**GOOD** — typed constructors per variant or a typed `Kind` enum:

```rust
impl Operation {
    pub fn add(lhs: Operand, rhs: Operand) -> Self { Self::Addition { lhs, rhs } }
    pub fn sub(lhs: Operand, rhs: Operand) -> Self { Self::Subtraction { lhs, rhs } }
}

// Or typed Kind enum if the caller has the kind as data:
pub enum OpKind { Add, Sub, Mul, Div }
impl Operation {
    pub fn new(kind: OpKind, lhs: Operand, rhs: Operand) -> Self {
        match kind {
            OpKind::Add => Self::Addition { lhs, rhs },
            OpKind::Sub => Self::Subtraction { lhs, rhs },
            /* compiler enforces exhaustive coverage */
        }
    }
}
```

**Why bad**: trades compile-time variant checking for runtime string
matching. Typos compile; logic bugs ship.

**Severity**: request-change.

**Reference**: [Rust API Guidelines, C-CUSTOM-TYPE](https://rust-lang.github.io/api-guidelines/type-safety.html)
— *"Use a deliberate type (whether enum, struct, or tuple) to convey
interpretation and invariants. `Widget::new(Small, Round)` is
preferable to `Widget::new(true, false)` because custom types make
intent explicit and support future expansion."*

### A4. Sub-trait inheritance misconception

**Flag if you see**: `trait B: A { ... }` with default methods, plus
an `impl B for T` block that does NOT also `impl A for T`.

**BAD**:

```rust
trait Animal { fn sound(&self) -> String; }
trait Cat: Animal {
    fn purr(&self) -> String { "purr".into() }
    fn sound(&self) -> String { self.purr() }   // does NOT satisfy Animal::sound
}
impl Cat for Tabby { /* ... */ }
// E0046: not all trait items implemented, missing: `sound`
```

**GOOD** — implement both traits separately:

```rust
impl Cat    for Tabby { fn purr(&self) -> String { "...".into() } }
impl Animal for Tabby { fn sound(&self) -> String { self.purr() } }
```

**Why bad**: `trait B: A` is a *trait bound* meaning "B implementors
must also implement A" — it does NOT mean B's default methods satisfy
A's required methods. Each implementing type satisfies each trait
independently.

**Severity**: block (the code won't compile, so reviewer's job is to
spot the intended design and propose the right shape).

**Reference**: `rustc --explain E0046` and the [Rust Reference on traits](https://doc.rust-lang.org/reference/items/traits.html).

### A5. Cross-domain mega-enum

**Flag if you see**:

```rust
enum Operation {
    Arithmetic(ArithmeticOp),
    Text(TextOp),
    Date(DateOp),
}
enum Operand {
    NumericValue(f64),
    StringValue(String),
    InstantValue(Instant),
}
```

A single enum tries to model multiple unrelated domains, with their
operands also unified.

**Why bad**: every dispatch site needs a 3-deep `match`. Type
mismatches between operations and operands (passing `StringValue` to
`Arithmetic::Add`) become runtime errors instead of compile errors.

**GOOD** — separate modules (or crates) per domain:

```rust
mod arithmetic { pub enum Op { Add, Sub, /* ... */ } pub struct Operand(f64); }
mod text       { pub enum Op { Concat, Substr, /* ... */ } pub struct Operand(String); }
mod date       { pub enum Op { AddDays, SubDays, /* ... */ } pub struct Operand(Instant); }
```

Each domain's `Op` matches against its own `Operand`. Cross-domain
operations are explicit conversions, not silent runtime errors.

**Severity**: request-change. Reveals an OO inheritance hierarchy
mistakenly modelled as nested enums.

**References**:

- [rust-unofficial/patterns *Prefer Small Crates*](https://rust-unofficial.github.io/patterns/patterns/structural/small-crates.html).
- Production examples: `serde` keeps Serializer/Deserializer per
  crate; `axum` separates request/response types per module — neither
  has an `AnyRequestKind` mega-enum.

---

## Borrow-Checker-Fight Anti-Patterns

Three patterns that paper over a borrow-checker conflict instead of
fixing the underlying design. All three trade compile-time safety for
runtime panics, hidden state, or undefined behavior.

### A6. `RefCell` used to bypass `&mut self`

**Flag if you see**: a struct field wrapped in `RefCell<T>` where the
only methods that touch it are mutating methods that could just take
`&mut self`, and there's no genuine reason for the `&self` interface
(no foreign trait being implemented that requires `&self`, no shared
ownership pattern, etc.).

**BAD**:

```rust
pub struct Calculator {
    history: RefCell<Vec<Calculation>>,
}
impl Calculator {
    pub fn add(&self, expr: String, result: f64) {  // why &self?
        self.history.borrow_mut().push(Calculation { expr, result });
    }
}
```

**GOOD**:

```rust
pub struct Calculator { history: Vec<Calculation> }
impl Calculator {
    pub fn add(&mut self, expr: String, result: f64) {
        self.history.push(Calculation { expr, result });
    }
    pub fn view_history(&self) -> &[Calculation] { &self.history }
}
```

**Why bad**: trades compile-time borrow checking for runtime
`borrow_mut()` panics. `RefCell` is only justified when:

1. You implement a trait whose method takes `&self` (Observer,
   Decorator, `From`, etc.) AND you genuinely need to mutate.
2. You need shared ownership in a single thread (`Rc<RefCell<...>>`)
   for a genuine shared-state design.

Outside those, redesign to `&mut self`.

**Severity**: request-change.

**Reference**: [rust-unofficial/patterns *Clone to satisfy the borrow checker*](https://rust-unofficial.github.io/patterns/anti_patterns/borrow_clone.html)
groups this under the same umbrella anti-pattern: *"treat `.clone()` as
a code smell warranting investigation"*. The same logic applies to
`RefCell` — both are workarounds for ownership-thinking gaps.

### A7. `*const T` / `&T` field pointing into an owned `Vec<T>`

**Flag if you see**: a struct that owns a `Vec<T>` (or `String`,
`BTreeMap`, or any growable container) AND has a field of type
`*const T`, `*mut T`, `&T`, or `Option<&T>` referring to elements of
that container. The safe-Rust version is rejected by the compiler as a
self-referential struct; the `unsafe` version is undefined behavior on
Vec reallocation.

**Severity**: **block**. After any `.push()` / `.insert()` /
`.extend()` that triggers reallocation, the pointer dangles. With
`unsafe`, this is UB; with `&T`, the compiler will reject it but a
determined coder may try `Pin` or `unsafe` to bypass.

**Suggested fix**: store a `usize` index instead. See
[refactor-templates.md "Pointer → index"](refactor-templates.md#pointer--index-escape-vec-reallocation-use-after-free)
for the canonical refactor. For graph-shaped data, prefer
[`slotmap`](https://github.com/orlp/slotmap), [`petgraph`](https://github.com/petgraph/petgraph),
or [`generational-arena`](https://github.com/fitzgen/generational-arena).

**References**:

- `std::vec::Vec` documentation: *"Modifying the vector may cause its
  buffer to be reallocated, which would also make any pointers to it
  invalid."*
- [Rust Reference, *Behavior considered undefined*](https://doc.rust-lang.org/reference/behavior-considered-undefined.html):
  *"A reference/pointer is dangling if not all of the bytes it points
  to are part of the same live allocation. ... is undefined behavior."*
- [Miri](https://github.com/rust-lang/miri) detects "out-of-bounds
  memory accesses and use-after-free", including Vec reallocation
  invalidating pointers. `cargo +nightly miri test` is the canonical
  detector.

### A8. `lazy_static!` / `OnceLock<Mutex<T>>` global state to avoid threading state

**Flag if you see**:

```rust
lazy_static! { static ref MEMORY: Mutex<Vec<f64>> = Mutex::new(Vec::new()); }
struct Calculator;  // unit struct — all state is global
```

or:

```rust
static CONFIG: OnceLock<Mutex<UserPreferences>> = OnceLock::new();
```

— but only when used to *avoid threading state through call chains*.
Legitimate uses (FFI handles, immutable config loaded once, true
singletons like crypto state) get a pass.

**Why bad**:

1. Tests that depend on global state become non-deterministic when
   `cargo test` runs them in parallel (Rust default).
2. Lock scope is hard to reason about across functions; deadlocks
   emerge under load.
3. Hides dependencies — a function's signature no longer tells you
   what state it touches.

**GOOD**: own state on the relevant struct; pass `&` / `&mut`
explicitly. If state must be shared at process scope (legitimate
singleton case), use `Arc<T>` with explicit construction in `main()`
and inject via constructor (rust-planning rule 14).

**Migration note**: `lazy_static` is in maintenance mode. Prefer
`std::sync::OnceLock` (stable since Rust 1.70) or
`std::sync::LazyLock` (stable since Rust 1.80) for the legitimate
cases. Production projects actively migrating in 2024–2026 (visible
via `gh search code 'lazy_static!' 'OnceLock' --language Rust`)
include `rustfs/rustfs`, `LGUG2Z/komorebi`, and `rustdesk/rustdesk` —
all show files containing both the old `lazy_static!` form and the
new `OnceLock<...>` form mid-migration.

**Severity**: request-change unless the PR justifies the global with a
specific reason.

# Part B — Validation Findings

The remainder of this file is the validation log: production-code
audits of the implementing skill's rules against major crates. Treat
each row as evidence that informed the rule's wording, not as a

## Detailed Findings — LLM Rules

### Rule 1: ALWAYS use Result, never unwrap() — PARTIAL

- **tokio** `src/io/blocking.rs`: Uses `unwrap()` on `Option::take()` where state machine design guarantees `Some`.
- **serde** `serde_core/src/ser/impls.rs`: Uses `write!(...).unwrap()` on `fmt::Write` for in-memory buffers where write is infallible.
- **tokio** extensively uses `expect("reason")` for true invariants: `expect("[internal exception] blocking task ran twice")`, `expect("io_uring not initialized")`.
- **Nuance:** Production libraries use `unwrap()` on structurally guaranteed operations. `expect("reason")` is the standard for documenting invariants. Rule should say "prefer Result/expect, avoid blind unwrap on fallible operations."

### Rule 2: ALWAYS use ? operator — PARTIAL

- **serde_derive** `src/de.rs`: Uses explicit `match` when multiple branches require different logic.
- **axum-core** `extract/mod.rs`: Uses `?` in concrete implementations.
- **Nuance:** `?` is preferred for straightforward propagation. Explicit match is correct when you need to handle Ok and Err differently beyond just propagating.

### Rule 3: ALWAYS prefer borrowing — PARTIAL

- **axum** `routing/mod.rs`: Takes `&str` for path parameters.
- **clap** `builder/command.rs`: Uses `impl Into<Str>`, `impl AsRef<str>`, `impl IntoResettable<String>` — generic trait bounds, not raw references.
- **axum**: Builder pattern methods take `self` (consuming), not `&mut self`.
- **Nuance:** Real pattern is `&str` for read-only, `impl Into<String>` for flexible APIs, owned types when function needs to store/move the data.

### Rule 4: ALWAYS use iterators — PARTIAL

- **tokio** `sync/mpsc/block.rs`: `for i in 0..BLOCK_CAP` with raw pointer arithmetic — iterators cannot abstract over this.
- **tokio** `runtime/scheduler/multi_thread/queue.rs`: Manual indexing for work-stealing with wrapped indices.
- **serde**, **ripgrep**: Highly idiomatic, virtually no manual index loops.
- **Nuance:** ~95% correct. Manual indexing for unsafe pointer code, circular buffers, dual-index traversal.

### Rule 5: ALWAYS derive Debug/Clone/PartialEq — PARTIAL

- **clap** `Command`: Derives `Debug` and `Clone` but NOT `PartialEq`.
- **tokio** `TcpListener`, `TcpStream`: Only `Debug` (manual impl). No `Clone` (unique resource), no `PartialEq`.
- **axum**: Uses `#[non_exhaustive]` on public enums (confirmed in extract/path/mod.rs).
- **Nuance:** `Debug` should be on virtually every public type. `Clone` omitted on resource types. `PartialEq` often inappropriate (closures, trait objects, I/O). Don't treat all three as equally mandatory.

### Rule 6: ALWAYS use thiserror for library errors — CHALLENGED

- **tokio**: Manual `impl Display` and `impl Error` for all error types.
- **axum/axum-core**: Manual implementation. Error wraps BoxError.
- **hyper**: Manual with custom `ErrorImpl`.
- **reqwest**: Manual with `Kind` enum and `BoxError` source.
- **sqlx**: DOES use `#[derive(thiserror::Error)]` — the exception.
- **Nuance:** Most major Rust libraries use manual impl, not thiserror. thiserror is more common in newer/smaller libraries. Both approaches valid. Change "ALWAYS" to "PREFER" or "CONSIDER."

### Rule 7: NEVER use Result<T, String> — VERIFIED

- No major library uses `Result<T, String>` in public APIs.
- All use typed errors implementing the `Error` trait.

### Rule 8: ALWAYS async for IO, never block runtime — VERIFIED

- tokio provides `spawn_blocking()` for blocking operations on dedicated thread pool.
- tokio tutorial warns about holding `std::sync::Mutex` across `.await`.
- axum docs warn holding locked Mutex across `.await` produces `!Send` futures.

### Rule 9: ALWAYS Arc<Mutex<T>> — PARTIAL

- **axum examples**: Uses `Arc<RwLock<HashMap<...>>>` for state (todos, key-value-store examples).
- **axum docs**: "Which kind of mutex you need depends on your use case."
- **tokio**: Offers `parking_lot` as optional feature.
- **rust-analyzer**: Uses `parking_lot`.
- **Nuance:** Should present as options: `Arc<Mutex<T>>` for simple cases, `Arc<RwLock<T>>` for read-heavy, `dashmap` for concurrent maps, `std::sync::Mutex` unless holding across `.await`.

### Rule 10: NEVER unsafe without SAFETY comment — PARTIAL

- **tokio**: Consistently uses `// SAFETY:` comments on all unsafe blocks.
- **crossbeam** `epoch/src/atomic.rs`: Many unsafe blocks WITHOUT safety comments.
- **clippy lint** `undocumented_unsafe_blocks`: In **restriction** category — NOT enabled by `clippy::all` or `clippy::pedantic`. Must opt in explicitly.
- **Nuance:** Best practice followed by top-tier projects; not universal. Lint is opt-in.

### Rule 11: ALWAYS clippy::all + pedantic — CHALLENGED

- **tokio**: Does NOT use `clippy::all` or `clippy::pedantic`. Uses `#![allow(...)]` for specific lints.
- **axum** (workspace Cargo.toml): Curated list of ~30 specific lints at warn level. No blanket pedantic.
- **serde**: Massive `#![allow(clippy::...)]` list suppressing dozens of pedantic lints.
- **Modern approach**: `[workspace.lints.clippy]` in Cargo.toml (stable since 1.74) with curated lint list.
- **Nuance:** `clippy::pedantic` is too noisy for real projects. Advice should be "curate a specific lint list" using workspace lints.

### Rule 12: ALWAYS typed newtypes — PARTIAL

- **uuid crate**: `pub struct Uuid(Bytes)` with `#[repr(transparent)]` — classic newtype.
- **axum**: Newtypes for extractors (`Path<T>`, `Json<T>`, `Query<T>`).
- **tokio/hyper**: Internal code uses raw `usize`, `u64` for indices/sizes without newtypes.
- **Nuance:** Good for domain IDs and validated values. "ALWAYS" overstates — adds boilerplate when confusion risk is low.

### Rule 13: ALWAYS tracing over log — VERIFIED

- **tokio**: Uses `tracing` internally.
- **axum**: Depends on `tracing`, no `log`.
- **sqlx**: Uses `tracing` with `features = ["log"]` for backward compat.
- **reqwest**: Still uses `log` crate — notable holdout.
- **#[instrument]**: Less pervasive than implied in major projects; most use manual tracing calls.

### Rule 14: ALWAYS edition = "2024" — PARTIAL

- Edition 2024 is stable since Rust 1.85.0 (February 20, 2025).
- **Async closures are NOT an edition 2024 feature** — they are edition-independent (stable in 1.85.0 on all editions). The skill's claim is inaccurate.
- Major projects (tokio, axum) haven't migrated yet; still on edition 2021.
- Correct for new projects in 2026.

### Rule 15: PREFER axum — VERIFIED

- Downloads: axum ~281M total vs actix-web ~64M vs rocket ~11M.
- Repository: `tokio-rs/axum` — confirmed tokio team maintained.
- actix-web 4.0+ works under `#[tokio::main]`; `#[actix_web::main]` only needed for actor support.

### Rule 16: Rc<RefCell<T>> is !Send — VERIFIED

- `Rc` explicitly implements `!Send` and `!Sync` (non-atomic reference counting).
- `tokio::spawn` requires `Send`, so futures with `Rc<RefCell<T>>` across `.await` fail to compile.
- Valid in single-threaded contexts (`LocalSet`, non-async code).

### Rule 17: NEVER clone to silence borrow checker — PARTIAL

- **tokio** `sync/mpsc/chan.rs`: Uses `.clone()` on Arc fields (not `Arc::clone()` form).
- **Arc::clone() convention**: tokio uses `x.clone()` on Arcs, not `Arc::clone(&x)`. clippy lint `clone_on_ref_ptr` is restriction-level, rarely enabled.
- **Nuance:** Advice is directionally correct — don't clone lazily. But cloning an Arc into an async task is idiomatic. `Arc::clone()` preference is not reflected in major projects.

### Rule 18: ALWAYS handle JoinHandle results — VERIFIED

- Dropping JoinHandle detaches the task; panics are silently swallowed.
- `JoinSet` exists (stable, `rt` feature) and is recommended for managing multiple tasks.
- Panics in spawned tasks caught by tokio; `JoinError::is_panic()` when awaited.

---

## Code Pattern Verification

### Cow<T> — VERIFIED
- serde docs: `Cow<'a, str>` with `#[serde(borrow)]` for zero-copy deserialization.
- `serde_cow` crate exists to fix default Cow always selecting `Cow::Owned`.

### Borrow Splitting — VERIFIED
- Rustonomicon ["Splitting Borrows"](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nomicon/borrow-splitting.html) confirms struct field disjointness.
- Bevy game engine has [dedicated cheat book page](https://bevy-cheatbook.github.io/pitfalls/split-borrows.html).

### let-else — VERIFIED
- Stable since Rust 1.65.0 (November 2022).

### if-let chains — VERIFIED
- Stable in Rust 1.88.0 (June 2025), 2024 edition only.
- Requires 2024 edition due to if-let temporary scope changes.

### RPITIT — VERIFIED
- Stable since 1.75.0 (December 2023).
- Not dyn-compatible; `#[async_trait]` or `trait_variant` still needed for dynamic dispatch.

### GATs — VERIFIED
- Stable since 1.65.0 (November 2022).
- LendingIterator with `type Item<'a> where Self: 'a` is canonical example.

### Type State Pattern — VERIFIED
- Documented by cliffle.com, Will Crichton, Rust Design Patterns book.
- PhantomData<State> is the correct zero-cost marker.
- Serde Serializer uses typestates for its state machine.

### Static vs Dynamic Dispatch — PARTIAL
- Static best performance: **Verified** (monomorphization, inlining).
- Dynamic smaller binary: **Verified** (one compiled version, vtable indirection).
- Enum "smallest binary": **Challenged** — depends on variant count and impl complexity. More accurate: "compact" or "comparable to dyn."

### LazyLock — VERIFIED
- Stable since 1.80.0 (July 2024).
- Replaces lazy_static! and once_cell::sync::Lazy.
- Clippy issue #12895 recommends std::sync::LazyLock.

### #[non_exhaustive] — PARTIAL (nuanced by library-vs-app-internal)
- **Published libraries use it:** axum (`ErrorKind`, `QueryRejection`), tokio-postgres (`SslMode`, `TargetSessionAttrs`), serde, tokio.
- **Application-internal crates often OMIT it deliberately:** Zed's `project::Event`, `CompletionSource`, `LspAction`, `ProjectClientState` all do NOT have `#[non_exhaustive]` — they want pattern-match exhaustiveness to catch "did you handle the new variant?" bugs across the workspace.
- **Rule:** use `#[non_exhaustive]` on public enums of **published libraries** (where external callers would break on a new variant); omit it in application-internal workspace crates where exhaustive matching is a feature.

## Validation pass 2 (2026-04-24) — Zed editor

Additional evidence collected against `zed-industries/zed` to test the new skill family's claims:

| Claim | Evidence from Zed | Update |
|---|---|---|
| Cargo workspace for large apps | 400+ member workspace | Confirmed |
| `[workspace.lints]` with curated list (not blanket pedantic) | Denies `dbg_macro`, `todo`, `declare_interior_mutable_const`, `redundant_clone`, `disallowed_methods`; allows style rules intentionally | Confirmed — Zed matches the recommended pattern exactly |
| Edition 2024 for new projects | Workspace uses `edition = "2024"` | Confirmed |
| `thiserror` for libraries, `anyhow` for apps | Zed's internal app crates (`editor`, `language`, `project`) use `anyhow::Result` pervasively, NOT just in `main.rs`. GPUI (more library-like) uses both thiserror AND anyhow. | **Nuanced:** anyhow extends to internal app crates, not only `main.rs`. Both coexist by role (app vs library), not file location. |
| `#[non_exhaustive]` on public enums | Zed's `project::Event`, `CompletionSource`, `LspAction` deliberately omit it | **Nuanced:** library-vs-app distinction matters (see above). |
| Newtype pattern for IDs | Extensive use: `WorktreeId`, `BufferId`, `LanguageServerId`, `ProjectEntryId`, `ReplicaId` | Strongly confirmed |
| "One runtime per binary" + Tokio default | Zed uses NEITHER Tokio nor smol. It has a **custom runtime** (GPUI's executor) wrapping `async-task` + platform primitives (GCD on macOS). | **Nuanced:** GUI applications frequently pick custom runtimes integrated with UI event loops; the rule "one runtime per binary" still holds, but "Tokio default" applies to headless services, not GUI apps. |
| Custom profile variants (e.g. `release-fast`) | Zed has `release-fast` variant with reduced optimization for faster iteration | Confirmed |
| MSRV declaration on libraries | Zed does NOT declare `rust-version` in its workspace | Consistent with guidance (Zed is an end-user app, not a library; MSRV rule was specifically for published libraries) |
| proptest for property-based testing | Antonio Scandurra at Zed pioneered property testing over async future interleavings to surface concurrency bugs — a strong validation and an extension of the recommendation into the async domain | Strongly confirmed; test-strategy.md updated to reference |
| mockall for trait-based mocks | Zed uses proptest + criterion + ctor in tests; NO mockall | Note: mockall is one option among several. GUI / state-heavy apps often use integration-test-heavy strategies with proptest instead. |
| No workspace-level feature flags | Zed configures features per-dependency, not at workspace level | Consistent with guidance that feature flags belong at composition-root level, not scattered |

### Fixes applied after Zed pass

1. **Rust-implementing SKILL.md Rule 5** — `#[non_exhaustive]` now explicitly conditioned on "published library public enums" vs "application-internal workspace crates"
2. **Rust-planning SKILL.md Rule 18** — `anyhow` framing expanded: applies throughout internal app crates, not only `main.rs`
3. **async-strategy.md runtime table** — added row for "Custom runtime integrated with UI event loop" (Zed GPUI, egui, iced, Bevy), with the "one runtime per binary" rule updated to note UI runtimes count
4. **test-strategy.md property-testing section** — added the async-execution-ordering use case (Zed's concurrency-bug-finding technique)

## Validation pass 4 (2026-04-24) — Rustls (security-critical library)

Validation against [rustls/rustls](https://github.com/rustls/rustls) — pure-Rust TLS 1.2/1.3 library with strong safety requirements, 15-member workspace, published on crates.io with significant downstream usage.

| Claim | Evidence | Update |
|---|---|---|
| Libraries use `#[non_exhaustive]` on public enums | `rustls::Error` and every sub-enum (`InvalidMessage`, `PeerIncompatible`, `PeerMisbehaved`, `CertificateError`, etc.) is marked `#[non_exhaustive]` | **Strongly confirmed** for published libraries |
| Hand-rolled `impl Error + Display` for top-tier libs | `rustls::Error` — 22 variants, manual impls (not thiserror) | Confirmed; rustls added to the hand-rolled-error list (ripgrep, tokio, hyper, serde, polars, rustls) |
| Hierarchical enum-of-enums for rich error domains | `Error` carries sub-enums: `InvalidMessage`, `PeerMisbehaved`, `CertificateError`. Top-level has 22 variants; sub-enums have 30-50 each | **New pattern documented** in error-strategy.md |
| `#![forbid(unsafe_code)]` at library crate root | rustls core declares `#![forbid(unsafe_code, unused_must_use)]`; delegates crypto unsafety to aws-lc-rs/ring provider crates | **Strongly confirmed;** documented in unsafe-strategy.md as "strongest isolation" pattern |
| `clippy::exhaustive_enums` / `clippy::exhaustive_structs` | rustls declares `#![warn(missing_docs, clippy::exhaustive_enums, clippy::exhaustive_structs)]` — clippy enforces `#[non_exhaustive]` discipline | **New pattern documented** in unsafe-strategy.md and workspace-layout.md |
| Process-level singleton with explicit install + constructor-injection fallback | `OnceLock<Arc<CryptoProvider>>` with `install_default()`/`get_default()`; ALSO `ClientConfig::builder().with_crypto_provider(...)` for explicit injection | **New pattern documented** as a pragmatic exception in architecture-patterns.md |
| `[workspace.lints]` with extensive curated list | rustls warns on `elided_lifetimes_in_paths`, `unnameable_types`, `unreachable_pub`, `unused_extern_crates`, `cloned_instead_of_copied`, `manual_let_else`, `needless_pass_by_ref_mut`, `or_fun_call`, `redundant_clone`, `use_self`, etc. | Confirmed; even stricter than nushell |
| no_std enforcement via workspace lints | `alloc_instead_of_core = "warn"`, `std_instead_of_core = "warn"` | **New pattern documented** in workspace-layout.md |
| no_std library with `extern crate alloc` | rustls is `#![no_std]` + uses `alloc` | Confirmed; TLS protocol is pure state machine, no stdlib needed |
| MSRV declared for published library | `rust-version = "1.85"` in rustls/Cargo.toml | Confirmed |
| `autotests = false, autobenches = false` | rustls/Cargo.toml disables auto-discovery | **New pattern** — worth noting for libraries with hand-curated test/bench layouts |
| `[patch.crates-io]` self-patching | rustls workspace patches itself so ecosystem crates depending on rustls via crates.io use the local copy | **New pattern documented** in workspace-layout.md |
| Pluggable crypto provider via feature flags | `ring` vs `aws-lc-rs` vs `fips` as compile-time choices | Confirmed; classic feature-flag-for-adapter-choice pattern |
| `zeroize` + `subtle` for crypto primitives | rustls workspace deps include both | Confirmed match for security-audit.md guidance |
| `CryptoProvider` as composition of trait objects (not trait) | `CryptoProvider { secure_random: &'static dyn SecureRandom, key_provider: &'static dyn KeyProvider, ... }` — struct holding trait objects | **Interesting pattern:** a "bag of capabilities" struct rather than a monolithic trait. Good when the capabilities are independent and swapping them independently is valuable. |

### Fixes applied after pass 4

1. **error-strategy.md** — added hierarchical enum-of-enums pattern (rustls), with `#![warn(clippy::exhaustive_enums)]` as the discipline enforcement
2. **unsafe-strategy.md** — new section on `#![forbid(unsafe_code)]` as "strongest isolation" with rustls as the canonical example; delegation to provider crates explained
3. **workspace-layout.md** — added no_std enforcement lints (`alloc_instead_of_core`, `std_instead_of_core`), `clippy::exhaustive_*` lints, and `[patch.crates-io]` self-patch pattern
4. **architecture-patterns.md** — added "Process-Level Default + Constructor Injection" as a documented exception to the "no global state" rule; conditions for when this pattern is appropriate
5. **Added rustls to hand-rolled-error list**

### Validation pass 4 sources

## Validation pass 5 (2026-04-24) — wgpu (GPU graphics/compute)

Validated against [gfx-rs/wgpu](https://github.com/gfx-rs/wgpu) — WebGPU-spec implementation; 26-member workspace; used by Firefox, Deno, Bevy. Used to ALSO author a new GPU subskill ([rust-implementing/gpu.md](../rust-implementing/gpu.md)).

| Claim | Evidence | Update |
|---|---|---|
| Concentrate unsafe in one layer, keep user crate safe | wgpu layers its crates: `wgpu` (user-facing, `#![warn(unsafe_op_in_unsafe_fn)]`) → `wgpu-core` (validation, minimal unsafe) → `wgpu-hal` (all the platform FFI unsafe) → `wgpu-types` (safe shared types) | **Strongly confirmed** as the canonical "delegate unsafe to a lower layer" pattern. Referenced in the new gpu.md. |
| `#[warn(unsafe_op_in_unsafe_fn)]` at library crate root | wgpu/src/lib.rs declares it | New lint worth mentioning in unsafe-strategy.md — enforces the `unsafe {}` block requirement inside `unsafe fn` (otherwise implicit, easy to miss). |
| Runtime-agnostic library | wgpu works with pollster, tokio, or GUI event loops without runtime lock-in | Confirmed; aligns with rust-planning/SKILL.md Rule 23. GUI-app custom runtime pattern from Zed extends naturally: Bevy drives wgpu from its own loop. |
| Multi-backend via feature flags | `vulkan`/`metal`/`dx12`/`gles`/`webgl`/`angle`/`vulkan-portability`/`wgsl`/`spirv`/`glsl`/`noop` | Classic "adapter via feature flag" pattern validated at scale (10+ mutually-selectable backends) |
| Dummy/mock backend for testing | `noop` backend — creates resources, no execution | **New testing pattern** documented in gpu.md. Conceptually different from mockall (which mocks one trait) — this is a whole-backend stub enabling resource-management testing on CI without a GPU. |
| Separate shader compiler crate | `naga` translates WGSL ↔ SPIR-V ↔ MSL ↔ HLSL ↔ GLSL | Architectural pattern: the shader compiler is its own crate, not embedded in wgpu-core. Validates "split by dependency surface" in [workspace-layout.md](../rust-planning/workspace-layout.md). |
| Error scope model distinct from Result | `Device::push_error_scope(ErrorFilter::Validation)` + `pop_error_scope()` | **Novel pattern** — spec-driven (WebGPU requires async error reporting). Documented in gpu.md. Doesn't contradict Rust error-handling rules; just a domain-specific layer. |
| `[workspace.lints]` with `ref_as_ptr = "warn"` | Additional lints externalized to `clippy.toml` | Worth noting the `clippy.toml` option — some config is per-crate-tree not per-workspace. |
| Custom profile with `opt-level = 3` for specific dev-dep | `[profile.dev.package."nv-flip-sys"] opt-level = 3` for image-comparison crate in dev builds | **New pattern** worth noting: per-package dev-build optimization, separate from the main `dev` profile. Add to workspace-layout.md opportunistically. |
| Edition 2021 (NOT 2024) for a large modern codebase | wgpu is still on edition 2021 | Data point: migration to 2024 isn't free; large multi-crate projects often lag by design. My "edition 2024 for new projects" rule is correct but shouldn't be over-read as "all projects must migrate." |
| MSRV 1.93 | Declared at workspace level | Confirmed |
| `bytemuck` + `glam` + `pollster` stack | Standard wgpu dependency set | Aligns with `bytemuck` recommendation in unsafe-strategy.md. `glam` newly worth referencing for GPU-adjacent math. |

### Updates applied after pass 5

1. **NEW subskill authored:** [rust-implementing/gpu.md](../rust-implementing/gpu.md) — covers the full wgpu stack with a complete compute example, error scopes, backend selection, noop testing, cross-platform (native + WebGPU), ecosystem crates, common pitfalls review checklist.
2. **rust-implementing/SKILL.md subskill table** — added the `gpu.md` row.

## Validation pass 6 (2026-04-24) — Cargo (Rust-team tooling) + Bevy (ECS game engine)

Two new domains validated: **cargo** (the Rust package manager itself, written by the Rust team) and **Bevy** (ECS game engine, 200+ member workspace).

### Cargo findings

| Claim | Evidence | Update |
|---|---|---|
| MSRV declared at workspace level | cargo root: `rust-version = "1.92"` workspace; `rust-version = "1.95"` on the main `cargo` crate | **New nuance:** MSRV split — workspace floor for downstream consumption vs. per-package requirement. Added to workspace-layout.md. |
| Edition 2024 adoption by Rust team code | cargo is on edition 2024 | Confirmed |
| Lint strategy alternative: noise-floor + specific denies | cargo uses `clippy::all = "allow"` + `clippy::correctness = "warn"` + specific denies (`dbg_macro`, `disallowed_methods`, `disallowed_types`, `print_stdout`, `print_stderr`, `self_named_module_files`) | **New pattern** added to workspace-layout.md as an alternative to the "extensive curated warn list" (rustls) and "aggressive deny" (nushell) patterns. This is a third model: start from allow-all-noise, add back only deliberate signals. |
| `print_stdout` / `print_stderr` denied via workspace lint | Cargo is a CLI tool but routes all output through a shell/formatter layer; lint-enforces the boundary | **New pattern** documented in workspace-layout.md — lint-as-architectural-boundary for CLI tools |
| thiserror + anyhow + snapbox all present | cargo workspace.dependencies | Confirmed |
| snapbox for CLI snapshot testing | Cargo is actively migrating from bespoke assertions to snapbox (PRs #13980, #14031, #14242, #14402, #14642); now supports SVG snapshots for terminal-styled output | **New testing tool** added to test-strategy.md alongside insta — snapbox is CLI-focused with stdout/stderr/filesystem snapshot support. |
| `gix` + `git2` coexistence | Cargo uses both `gix` (pure-Rust git) and `git2` (libgit2) — pattern: gradual migration with both alternatives alive | **Pattern worth knowing** — "parallel implementations during migration" — but not worth a separate section. |
| Credential helpers split per platform | `cargo-credential-libsecret` (Linux), `-macos-keychain` (macOS), `-wincred` (Windows) as separate crates | Confirmed "split by platform/dependency surface" — already documented indirectly. |
| HTTP transport as mutually-exclusive feature | `http-transport-curl` vs `http-transport-reqwest` | Classic adapter-via-feature pattern — already documented. |

### Bevy findings

| Claim | Evidence | Update |
|---|---|---|
| Workspace-level `unsafe_code = "deny"` with per-crate opt-in | Bevy's `[workspace.lints.rust]` has `unsafe_code = "deny"`; specific crates add `#[allow(unsafe_code)]` where needed | **New pattern** contrasting with rustls's per-crate `#![forbid(unsafe_code)]`. `forbid` is absolute; `deny` + `allow` is escapable. Documented in unsafe-strategy.md. |
| `undocumented_unsafe_blocks = "warn"` enforces SAFETY comments | Clippy lint in Bevy's workspace.lints.clippy | Confirmed — Bevy is a great scale example (200+ crates with enforced SAFETY discipline). |
| Compile-fail tests as dedicated workspace crates | `crates/bevy_derive/compile_fail`, `crates/bevy_ecs/compile_fail`, `crates/bevy_reflect/compile_fail` | **New placement pattern** documented in test-strategy.md as alternative to in-crate `tests/trybuild.rs`. |
| ~200+ features, hierarchical (profiles / collections / granular) | Bevy features include `2d`, `3d`, `ui` (profiles), `default_app`, `common_api` (collections), `bevy_animation`, `bevy_gltf` (granular); delegate to `bevy_internal` | Third feature-architecture pattern after nushell's tiered and ripgrep's facade. Already documented generally. |
| Custom async primitives instead of tokio/smol | `futures-lite` + `event-listener` + `futures-timer` | **Another data point** for "GUI/game apps use custom runtimes" — aligns with Zed findings. Game/sim/editor domain pattern: async primitives without a full runtime, driven by the game loop. |
| No workspace.dependencies | Bevy places deps per-crate rather than centralizing | **Contrast** to my recommendation: centralizing via `[workspace.dependencies]` is recommended but not universal. Bevy's 200+ crates with varied feature sets may justify decentralization. Data point, not a rule change. |
| ECS architectural paradigm | Bevy's core pattern: World (data) + Entities + Components + Systems + Queries + Archetypes | **New section** added to rust-planning/SKILL.md §16 "Architectural Paradigms Not Covered Here" — noting that ECS, actor-model frameworks, and reactive GUI DSLs have their own architectural rules that supersede the generic trait-based patterns in this skill. |
| Edition 2024, MSRV 1.95 | Confirmed | Consistent with cargo's main-package MSRV. |

### Updates applied after pass 6

1. **workspace-layout.md** — added: (a) MSRV split pattern (workspace vs package); (b) cargo's lint-strategy alternative (`all = "allow"` + `correctness = "warn"` + specific denies); (c) `print_stdout`/`print_stderr` lint-as-boundary pattern for CLI tools; (d) note on Bevy's workspace `unsafe_code = "deny"` vs per-crate `forbid` alongside the existing examples.
2. **unsafe-strategy.md** — added section contrasting `forbid(unsafe_code)` (absolute, rustls) vs workspace `deny` + per-crate `allow` (escapable, Bevy).
3. **test-strategy.md** — added: (a) `snapbox` for CLI stdout/stderr/filesystem snapshots, with note about cargo's ongoing migration; (b) compile-fail crate placement patterns (in-crate vs dedicated workspace-member crate, Bevy pattern).
4. **rust-planning/SKILL.md §16** — NEW section "Architectural Paradigms Not Covered Here" acknowledging ECS (Bevy, hecs, specs), actor-model frameworks (Actix, Ractor), and declarative GUI DSLs (Leptos, Dioxus, Yew) as paradigms where the skill's generic rules don't fully apply. Tells users to load the ecosystem's docs first and use this skill only for non-paradigm parts (error handling, async, testing, workspace layout).

## Validation pass 7 (2026-04-24) — Zola (static-site generator) + tokio-postgres (DB protocol)

Two contrasting extremes of error strategy: Zola does the absolute minimum (`pub use anyhow::*;`) and tokio-postgres hand-rolls the whole thing.

### Zola findings

| Claim | Evidence | Update |
|---|---|---|
| App-level anyhow usage | Zola's entire custom error crate is `pub use anyhow::*;` — a single re-export | **New pattern documented** in error-strategy.md: "the minimum application-error strategy." Legitimate and under-appreciated. Apps that don't pattern-match on errors get all of anyhow's value with zero boilerplate, plus the indirection lets them swap strategies later with one edit. |
| Edition 2024 in a mature CLI app | Zola root uses edition = "2024" | Confirmed |
| CLI feature architecture | Zola features: `default = ["rust-tls"]`, `native-tls`, `indexing-zh`, `indexing-ja` — TLS backends + optional language-specific indexing | Classic "adapter via feature" + optional capability pattern |
| Own `errors` workspace crate that wraps anyhow | `components/errors` exists but only re-exports | Subtle pattern: abstract the error crate behind your own indirection so you can swap later |
| Release profile — aggressive LTO + strip | `lto = true, codegen-units = 1, strip = true` | Standard "size + speed optimized" profile for a distributed CLI |
| No workspace-level lints | `[workspace.lints]` not present | Data point: not universal; many projects skip this |

### tokio-postgres (rust-postgres) findings

| Claim | Evidence | Update |
|---|---|---|
| Yet another hand-rolled Error struct | `Error` wraps `Box<ErrorInner>` with a `Kind` enum (18 variants) + optional cause chain; implements `Display` and `Error` manually | **Hand-rolled error list grows to 7:** ripgrep, tokio, hyper, serde, polars, rustls, tokio-postgres |
| Published library **without** `#[non_exhaustive]` | `Error` struct and `Kind` enum both lack the attribute | **Reinforces the "library-vs-app" rule is too simplistic.** tokio-postgres is a published library where the variants track the Postgres wire protocol (stable for decades). Exhaustive matching is a feature there — callers who branch on `Kind::Authentication` don't want to silently miss a new variant. Documented as a contrast to rustls's hierarchical-with-non_exhaustive design in error-strategy.md. |
| Crate-split by dependency surface | 9 crates: `tokio-postgres`, `postgres` (sync), `postgres-protocol` (wire), `postgres-types` (type conversion), `postgres-native-tls`, `postgres-openssl`, `postgres-derive`, `postgres-derive-test`, `codegen` | Confirms "split by dependency surface" at scale — protocol/wire/types/TLS/sync-wrapper all separate crates |
| TLS as separate adapter crates | `postgres-native-tls` and `postgres-openssl` live as peers alongside the main crate | Classic "adapter selection by crate" — different from feature-flag selection |
| `debug = 2` in release profile | Full debug symbols preserved in release builds | **New pattern** documented in workspace-layout.md: for long-running services where production-time debugging is important, trade ~3-10x binary size for rich local-variable info in backtraces/core-dumps |
| `Box<dyn Error>` internally, NOT in public API | `ErrorInner` wraps a `Box<dyn Error + Sync + Send>` cause | The "never Box<dyn Error> in public APIs" rule still holds — tokio-postgres exposes `Error::source()` not the box directly |
| `SqlState` mapping via `Error::code()` that downcasts | Domain-specific error semantics (SQLSTATE codes) integrated cleanly | Interesting pattern: domain-specific error metadata exposed via typed accessor rather than a dedicated variant |

### Updates applied after pass 7

1. **error-strategy.md** — added tokio-postgres to hand-rolled-error list; added contrast between "flat hand-rolled, no `#[non_exhaustive]`" (tokio-postgres) vs "hierarchical + `#[non_exhaustive]`" (rustls) as two valid library patterns; added "The minimum application-error strategy (Zola pattern)" section documenting `pub use anyhow::*;` in a dedicated errors crate.
2. **workspace-layout.md** — added note about `debug = 2` in release for production-debug-symbol preservation; cited tokio-postgres as the example.

## Validation pass 8 (2026-04-24) — rust-analyzer + Redox kernel

Two very-different domains: **rust-analyzer** (IDE tooling, incremental-query compiler internals) and **Redox** (microkernel OS in Rust, no_std bare-metal).

### rust-analyzer findings

| Claim | Evidence | Update |
|---|---|---|
| Graded-severity clippy hierarchy | `correctness = deny`, `perf = deny`, `style = warn`, `suspicious = warn`, `restriction = allow` with hand-picked overrides | **New fourth lint-strategy pattern** documented in workspace-layout.md, alongside nushell's aggressive-deny, rustls's curated-warn, and cargo's all-allow-plus-specific-denies |
| `dev-rel` custom profile | Inherits from release but `debug = 2` for debuggability of optimized code | Pattern documented in workspace-layout.md |
| Per-dependency `opt-level = 3` in dev profile | Selected hot deps (rowan, rustc-hash, smol_str, salsa) optimized even in dev | Pattern already common; now cited |
| Salsa for incremental query-based architecture | `salsa = "0.26"` with `["rayon", "salsa_unstable", "macros", "inventory"]` | **New architectural paradigm** added to rust-planning/SKILL.md §16 alongside ECS and kernel/bare-metal — for query-heavy derived-state tools (compilers, LSPs, static analyzers, build tools) |
| Compact data-structure crates | `smol_str`, `la-arena`, `thin-vec`, `triomphe`, `hashbrown` (direct), `dashmap` (pinned) | **New table added** to performance-catalog.md §4 listing compact std-alternative crates for when profiling shows std collections dominating (IDE latency, memory-constrained data structures) |
| `anyhow` only, no `thiserror` | Root Cargo.toml | Reinforces Zola's data point: application-scale tools can run on pure anyhow |
| Edition 2024, MSRV 1.91 | Root workspace | Older MSRV than cargo (1.95) — data point that Rust-adjacent tooling prioritizes compatibility |
| **Parking_lot absent** | `Notably absent: parking_lot` per the Cargo.toml analysis | **Corrects earlier evidence** in this file: the pass-1 baseline table noted rust-analyzer used parking_lot. Current rust-analyzer has moved away from it. Removed the parking_lot=rust-analyzer citation from this file's primary sources list. |
| `dashmap` pinned to 6.1.0 | With `raw-api` feature | Version-pinning for API stability when using non-guaranteed features — general pattern worth being aware of in review |

### Redox kernel findings

| Claim | Evidence | Update |
|---|---|---|
| Kernel lint strategy emphasizes panic prevention + overflow | `arithmetic_side_effects = "warn"`, `indexing_slicing = "warn"`, `unwrap_used = "warn"`, `not_unsafe_ptr_arg_deref = "deny"`, `unreachable_patterns = "deny"` | **New kernel/safety-critical variant** documented in workspace-layout.md as a fifth lint-strategy pattern |
| `panic = "abort"` required in kernel profiles | Both dev and release | **New pattern documented** in workspace-layout.md: kernel/bare-metal `no_std` environments without unwinding require panic=abort; not merely an optimization |
| Pure core-type errors (no anyhow/thiserror) | Kernel uses `redox_syscall` error types — integer error codes at syscall boundaries | **NEW section added** to error-strategy.md §7.5 "The kernel / syscall boundary" — documents the integer-error-code pattern for ABI-constrained boundaries. `Result<T, TypedError>` internally, integer at the boundary. Not an anti-pattern — the correct pattern for this specific case. |
| Kernel dependency stack | `spin` (spinlocks — no OS synchronization primitives available), `linked_list_allocator` (global allocator in bare metal), `bitfield`/`bitflags` (register manipulation), `fdt` (device tree parsing for ARM/RISC-V) | Kernel-specific canon; noted in rust-planning/SKILL.md §16 "Paradigms not covered here" |
| Multi-arch target gating | `cfg(target_arch = "x86_64")`, `"riscv64"`, etc. with arch-specific crates (`raw-cpuid`, `sbi-rt`) | Standard `cfg`-gated cross-architecture pattern; nothing new |
| No aarch64 in main kernel | — | Data point; Redox's aarch64 support is evolving separately |

### Updates applied after pass 8

1. **workspace-layout.md** — added: (a) graded-severity clippy pattern (rust-analyzer) as fourth lint-strategy; (b) kernel/safety-critical lint variant (Redox); (c) `dev-rel` profile pattern; (d) per-dependency `opt-level = 3` in dev explicit example; (e) `panic = "abort"` as kernel requirement note.
2. **performance-catalog.md** §4 — added compact-alternative-crates table (smol_str, SmallVec, thin-vec, triomphe, la-arena) with the rust-analyzer stack rationale.
3. **error-strategy.md** — added §7.5 "The kernel / syscall boundary (Redox pattern)" — integer-error-code-at-ABI, typed-Result-internally, with the note that this isn't an anti-pattern for FFI/kernel boundaries.
4. **rust-planning/SKILL.md §16** — expanded "Architectural Paradigms Not Covered Here" to include (a) incremental-query compiler tooling (salsa-based, rust-analyzer/rustc model) and (b) kernel/bare-metal/no_std systems (Redox, embedded). Now 5 paradigms noted there.

Also: earlier evidence in this file claimed rust-analyzer uses `parking_lot`. The current root Cargo.toml confirms it does NOT. The earlier baseline was either outdated or from a different rust-analyzer crate. Left the pass-1 reference but added a follow-up note.

### Pass 8 sources
- [rust-lang/rust-analyzer](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-analyzer) — root `Cargo.toml`; graded clippy, salsa, rowan, compact data structures
- [redox-os/kernel](https://github.com/redox-os/kernel) — root `Cargo.toml`; kernel lints, panic=abort, integer error codes

## Validation pass 9 (2026-04-24) — Embassy + esp-hal (embedded async, RP2350/ESP32)

Validated against the embedded-Rust ecosystem: **embassy** (modern async embedded framework) and **esp-hal** (Espressif's official HAL for ESP32 family). Covers the user's `RP2350`/`ESP32` ask via `embassy-rp` and esp-hal's embassy integration.

| Claim | Evidence | Update |
|---|---|---|
| Platform-selection via mutually-exclusive features | embassy-executor's `platform-cortex-m` / `platform-cortex-ar` / `platform-riscv32` / `platform-wasm` / `platform-avr` / `platform-std` / `platform-spin`; embassy-rp's `rp2040` / `rp235xa` / `rp235xb` | **New pattern** documented in workspace-layout.md: architecture-level and chip-level selection via exactly-one-of-N features. With `_prefix` convention for internal shared-implementation features. |
| Hardware-variant features for board-level BSPs | embassy-rp's flash boot2 features (`W25Q080`, `GD25Q64C`, generic, RAM-copy); RP2350 image-def features (`imagedef-secure-exe` vs `imagedef-nonsecure-exe`) | **New pattern** documented: feature-as-hardware-selector for boards that share a HAL but ship with different silicon. |
| CI build matrix in Cargo.toml metadata | embassy-executor declares `[package.metadata.embassy]` with 40+ target × feature combinations for cross-architecture CI | **New pattern** documented in workspace-layout.md — metadata-driven CI matrix alongside the source of truth (features). |
| Async-first embedded framework | Embassy makes async peripherals the default API; no sync/async toggle. Multiple `embedded-hal` versions coexist (`embedded-hal-02`, `embedded-hal-1`, `embedded-hal-async`) during the v0.2→v1.0 transition | **New paradigm** added to rust-planning/SKILL.md §16: async-first embedded firmware as a distinct paradigm from kernel/bare-metal (which this skill also lists as separate). |
| Scheduler-mode features | Embassy exposes `scheduler-deadline` and `scheduler-priority` — configurable scheduling modes | Data point: even embedded executors expose scheduling choices; not universal (std Tokio also has `current_thread` vs `multi_thread`). |
| Embedded ecosystem canon | `critical-section` (concurrency primitive), `portable-atomic` (atomics polyfill), `defmt` (binary logging), `heapless` (no_std collections), `static_cell` (statically-allocated runtime-init) | **New** — documented in rust-planning/async-strategy.md (runtime table for embassy row) and rust-planning/SKILL.md §16 (async-first embedded paradigm). Cross-references to chip-specific skills (`rp2040`, `rp2350`, `esp32-c`). |
| Edition 2024 in embedded code | embassy workspace on edition 2024 | Confirmed — even MCU-targeting Rust code uses 2024 edition |
| `panic = "abort"` required in embedded profile | Consistent with Redox finding; embedded profiles always use `panic = "abort"` | Confirmed; already documented from Redox. |
| Multi-embedded-hal-version coexistence pattern | embassy-rp pulls `embedded-hal-02` + `embedded-hal-1` + `embedded-hal-async` all at once to bridge the v0.2→v1.0 ecosystem transition | Data point: major ecosystem transitions require parallel-version support. Same pattern as cargo's `gix` + `git2`. |

### Updates applied after pass 9

1. **rust-planning/SKILL.md §16** — added "Async-first embedded firmware" as sixth architectural paradigm, with the embedded ecosystem stack (`critical-section`, `portable-atomic`, `defmt`, `heapless`, `static_cell`) and cross-references to chip skills (`rp2040`, `rp2350`, `esp32-c`).
2. **rust-planning/async-strategy.md** — expanded the embassy row of the runtime table with the chip list, architecture-selection pattern, and ecosystem dependency list.
3. **rust-planning/workspace-layout.md** — added: (a) platform-selection via mutually-exclusive features pattern (embassy); (b) hardware-variant features for board-level BSPs (embassy-rp flash variants); (c) CI build matrix via `[package.metadata.*]` pattern (embassy's 40+ combinations).

## Validation pass 10 (2026-04-24) — OPC UA + tokio-modbus (industrial protocols)

Validated against the industrial-protocol domain: **locka99/opcua** (full OPC UA client + server — industrial automation, 10-crate workspace) and **slowtec/tokio-modbus** (Modbus TCP/RTU — the workhorse industrial fieldbus).

| Claim | Evidence | Update |
|---|---|---|
| Protocol-implementation canonical crate layout | OPC UA splits as `opcua-types` + `opcua-core` + `opcua-crypto` + `opcua-client` + `opcua-server`. rust-postgres splits as `postgres-protocol` + `postgres-types` + `tokio-postgres` + `postgres-native-tls` + `postgres-openssl`. rustls splits similarly. | **New pattern documented** in rust-planning/architecture-patterns.md — "Protocol-Implementation Crate Layout" with canonical decomposition (types / core / crypto / client / server / TLS-adapter-per-backend) and the rationale for each split. |
| Code generation from protocol specifications | OPC UA uses machine-generated types from XML nodesets; the generator was itself migrated from JavaScript to Rust; output committed to the `opcua-types` crate | **New subsection** in architecture-patterns.md documenting: (a) `build.rs`-driven codegen; (b) separate generator crate with committed output (OPC UA pattern); (c) macro-based (`prost`, `sqlx::query!`). Trade-offs for each. |
| Orthogonal-axis feature architecture | tokio-modbus has 8 features along THREE axes: transport (rtu/tcp/rtu-over-tcp-server) × mode (sync/server) × base. Named features compose: `rtu-sync`, `tcp-server`, etc. | **New pattern documented** in workspace-layout.md — orthogonal-axis features, with the tokio-modbus example. Contrasts with the tiered/hierarchical pattern (nushell) and facade pattern (ripgrep). Fits when dimensions are genuinely independent. |
| Sync-wrapper-around-async-library via feature | tokio-modbus offers `rtu-sync` and `tcp-sync` as sync variants that internally use a private tokio runtime with `block_on` | **New pattern documented** in async-strategy.md §5.5 — when/when-not to offer sync wrappers. Fits async-first libraries whose users include sync environments (CLI, industrial scripts, PLC comms). |
| Byte-stream protocol framing via `tokio_util::codec` | tokio-modbus uses codec feature for RTU/TCP framing abstraction. MQTT libs, HTTP libs, custom-binary protocols all converge on `Decoder`/`Encoder`/`Framed` | **New section documented** in rust-implementing/async-patterns.md — complete Decoder/Encoder/Framed example with partial-read handling, `BytesMut` buffer management, and typed errors. Pattern for any byte-level protocol parsing. |
| Release profile for industrial/edge binaries | OPC UA uses `opt-level = 'z'` + `lto = true` + `panic = 'abort'` for small binaries on constrained industrial hardware | Confirms existing workspace-layout.md size-optimized profile advice for edge/embedded deployment targets. |
| `log` crate instead of `tracing` in libraries | tokio-modbus uses `log` not `tracing`. Same choice reqwest made. | Data point: libraries weighing dep-footprint trade-offs choose `log` over `tracing` for smaller transitive graph. `tracing` remains the default for application-tier code. |
| `async-trait` still used alongside native async fn in traits | tokio-modbus (MSRV 1.85) still uses `async-trait 0.1.77` | Data point: native `async fn` in traits (stable since 1.75) has limitations (not dyn-compatible, no `Send` bounds without `trait_variant`). `async-trait` remains valuable for dyn-compatible + `Send`-bounded async traits. |
| MSRV declared for a protocol library | tokio-modbus: `rust-version = "1.85"` | Consistent with other library patterns. |
| Language update: master/slave → client/server | tokio-modbus explicitly renames in docs: "master is called client and slave is called server" | Cultural update in modern protocol libraries moving away from legacy terminology. Worth being aware of in reviews. Not a rule change. |

### Updates applied after pass 10

1. **architecture-patterns.md** — added "Protocol-Implementation Crate Layout" section with the canonical types/core/crypto/client/server split pattern, covering OPC UA, rust-postgres, rustls; plus code-generation-from-spec options with trade-offs.
2. **workspace-layout.md** — added orthogonal-axis features pattern (tokio-modbus) alongside existing tiered (nushell) and facade (ripgrep) patterns.
3. **async-strategy.md** — added Decision 5.5 "Sync wrapper around an async library" documenting when to offer sync feature variants and when not to.
4. **rust-implementing/async-patterns.md** — added "Byte-stream protocol framing: `tokio_util::codec`" section with complete Decoder/Encoder/Framed example including partial-read handling and typed errors. Applies to any wire protocol — Modbus, MQTT, HTTP, length-prefix, line-delimited, TLV.

## Validation pass 11 (2026-04-24) — image + ffmpeg-next (multimedia processing)

Validated against the image and video processing domain: **image-rs/image** (the canonical pure-Rust image library) and **ffmpeg-next** (Rust bindings to FFmpeg — video/audio via heavy C FFI).

### image-rs/image findings

| Claim | Evidence | Update |
|---|---|---|
| Single-crate library with per-format feature flags | Features: `avif`, `bmp`, `exr`, `ff`, `gif`, `hdr`, `ico`, `jpeg`, `png`, `pnm`, `qoi`, `tga`, `tiff`, `webp`. Default enables common ones via `default-formats`. | Classic "capability-as-feature" pattern at 14 formats |
| Pure-Rust-vs-C-binding dual stack | Pure-Rust `ravif` as default AVIF encoder; opt-in `avif-native` pulls in C-based `dav1d`. Similar choice per format throughout the crate. | **New pattern documented** in workspace-layout.md: let users pick pure-Rust (safer, smaller deps) vs C-based (faster, more features) per capability. |
| Feature composition for compound capabilities | `ico = ["bmp", "png"]` — ICO decoding requires both sub-formats | **New pattern documented** — compound features that compose primitive features. Cargo supports this natively; worth knowing as an intentional design tool. |
| `bytemuck` + `byteorder-lite` for pixel format manipulation | Direct deps | bytemuck use confirmed yet again across data-heavy crates |
| Edition 2021, MSRV 1.88 | Root `Cargo.toml` | Data point: MSRV 1.88 is later than rust-analyzer (1.91) but earlier than cargo (1.95) and Bevy (1.95). Libraries with broad user bases tend to lag the bleeding edge. |
| No custom profiles | Uses Rust defaults | Data point: not every published library needs custom profiles; defaults are fine for pure-Rust compute-heavy crates where users set their own release tuning. |
| No `[workspace.lints]` | Single crate | Single-crate libraries can't use workspace lints (by definition); alternative would be `#![warn(...)]` at crate root, which this crate also doesn't heavily configure. Data point on variability. |

### ffmpeg-next findings

| Claim | Evidence | Update |
|---|---|---|
| `-sys` + safe-wrapper crate pair for large C library FFI | `ffmpeg-sys-next` (raw FFI) + `ffmpeg-next` (safe wrappers) | **New canonical pattern documented** in rust-planning/unsafe-strategy.md §9.3.1 — the `*-sys` + safe-wrapper split with rationale (re-use across wrappers, isolated rebuilds, review boundary, separate linking story). Listed other `-sys` pairs: openssl-sys/openssl, libgit2-sys/git2, curl-sys/curl, zstd-sys/zstd, libsqlite3-sys/rusqlite. |
| Massive feature surface (30+ codec/filter features) | Individual features for x264, x265, opus, vorbis, gnutls, openssl, fontconfig, freetype, opencv, vmaf, etc. | **New pattern documented** in workspace-layout.md: massive feature surface appropriate for wrappers over large multi-component C libraries. Binary size, license, CVE exposure all benefit from explicit opt-in. Counter-pattern is a single `full` feature. |
| Feature-as-license-decision | `gpl`, `nonfree`, `v3` features gate GPL-licensed, non-free, and LGPL-v3 components | **New pattern documented** — license commitment as explicit build-time decision rather than hidden transitive consequence. Particularly important for wrappers over permissively-licensed libraries that have commercially-incompatible plugins. |
| Platform-specific feature gates | RPi support, hardware acceleration toggles | Consistent with embassy/embedded patterns — platform-specific features are standard |
| `build = "build.rs"` delegated to `-sys` crate | Safe wrapper doesn't duplicate linking logic | Reinforces the `-sys` split rationale |
| No edition/MSRV visible in excerpt | Either defaults or specified outside this section | Data point: metadata requirements vary per project |

### Updates applied after pass 11

1. **rust-planning/unsafe-strategy.md** — added §9.3.1 "The `*-sys` + safe-wrapper crate pair" with canonical examples (ffmpeg-sys-next/ffmpeg-next, openssl-sys/openssl, libgit2-sys/git2, etc.), rationale for the split, and when to use vs not.
2. **rust-planning/workspace-layout.md** — added three new feature-architecture patterns:
   - **Pure-Rust vs C-binding dual stack** (image-rs): offer both, default to pure-Rust, opt-in C for perf.
   - **Feature composition** (image-rs `ico = ["bmp", "png"]`): compound features composing primitives.
   - **Feature-as-license-decision** (ffmpeg-next `gpl`, `nonfree`, `v3`): license commitment as explicit opt-in.
   - **Massive feature surface** (ffmpeg-next 30+ component features): appropriate for wrappers over large multi-component C libraries.

### Pass 11 sources

## Validation pass 3 (2026-04-24) — Polars (data/perf) and Nushell (shell/CLI)

Additional evidence from two new domains: **polars** (columnar data, SIMD-heavy, published library on crates.io) and **nushell** (large extensible shell, end-user application with plugin system).

### Polars findings

| Claim | Evidence | Update |
|---|---|---|
| Hand-rolled error pattern at scale | `PolarsError` — 15 variants, no thiserror, manual `impl Error + Display + From`; NO `#[non_exhaustive]` | Confirmed; polars added to the hand-rolled-error list (ripgrep, tokio, hyper, serde, polars). |
| `PolarsResult<T>` type alias | `pub type PolarsResult<T> = Result<T, PolarsError>;` | Added as pattern to error-strategy.md |
| `ErrString(Cow<'static, str>)` for error messages | Avoids allocation for canned error strings | New pattern documented in error-strategy.md |
| `Arc<io::Error>` to make enclosing errors `Clone` | `IO { error: Arc<io::Error>, msg: Option<ErrString> }` | New pattern documented in error-strategy.md |
| Rayon for CPU parallelism | Rayon as direct dep; `.par_iter()` patterns | Confirmed; no change |
| Tokio used selectively for I/O | Tokio present but not the primary runtime | Confirmed; polars is a good example of "sync library, async escape hatch" |
| `bytemuck::Pod`/`Zeroable` for safe transmutation | polars-core has `bytemuck` as direct dep | **New section added** to unsafe-strategy.md |
| `xxhash-rust` as hasher | Used for columnar hashing | **Added** as third option in performance-catalog.md (alongside ahash / fxhash) |
| Minimal `[workspace.lints]` | Only `collapsible_if = "allow"`, nothing else | Data point: even major projects don't always use extensive curated lints; the rule "avoid blanket pedantic" holds. |
| 10-member workspace + Edition 2024 | — | Confirmed |

### Nushell findings

| Claim | Evidence | Update |
|---|---|---|
| `thiserror` + `miette` combination for CLI errors | `ShellError` derives **both** `thiserror::Error` AND `miette::Diagnostic`; full use of `#[diagnostic(code(...))]`, `#[label]`, `#[help]`, `#[source_code]`, `#[related]`, `#[error(transparent)] #[diagnostic(transparent)]` | **New section added** to error-strategy.md as "the CLI-app stack" |
| miette + thiserror + anyhow all coexist | All three in nushell's workspace.dependencies | Confirmed; validates the existing advice that they coexist |
| `#[diagnostic(code(ns::category::name))]` | nushell uses codes like `nu::shell::variable_not_found` | Added as pattern element in error-strategy.md |
| MSRV declared for an end-user app | nushell declares `rust-version = "1.93.1"` | **Contradicts earlier Zed-based framing.** Updated rust-planning/SKILL.md §5.6: MSRV is optional for apps; declaring buys build reproducibility + shield against silent toolchain creep. |
| Aggressive workspace clippy lints | `unwrap_used = "deny"`, `format_push_string = "warn"`, `unchecked_time_subtraction = "warn"` | Confirmed; cited in workspace-layout.md as "aggressive project example" |
| Tiered feature architecture | `full` (non-mutually-exclusive) / `default` (core capabilities) / `stable` (alias of default) | **New section added** to workspace-layout.md |
| Multiple custom profiles | `release` with `opt-level = "s"`, `profiling`, `ci` | Confirmed |
| `rstest` for parametrized tests | Used across nushell tests | **New section added** to test-strategy.md; also added to the mocking-strategy table |
| `pretty_assertions` for prettier `assert_eq!` diffs | Dev-dependency | Added to test-strategy.md mocking table |
| 39-member workspace, Edition 2024 | — | Confirmed |

### Summary of skill updates applied after pass 3

1. **error-strategy.md** — added polars hand-rolled `ErrString(Cow<'static, str>)` + `Arc<io::Error>` patterns; added the full nushell thiserror+miette CLI-app stack with the complete list of miette attributes (`#[diagnostic(code)]`, `#[label]`, `#[help]`, `#[source_code]`, `#[related]`, `#[error(transparent)]`)
2. **unsafe-strategy.md** — added `bytemuck::Pod`/`Zeroable` section with Pod constraints and typical use cases (wire protocols, GPU uploads, arrow/columnar data)
3. **test-strategy.md** — added `rstest` for parametrized tests, `pretty_assertions` for prettier diffs
4. **workspace-layout.md** — added tiered `full`/`default`/`stable` feature architecture pattern; added nushell's `unwrap_used = "deny"` as aggressive-lint example
5. **performance-catalog.md** — added `xxhash-rust` as third hasher option (alongside ahash, fxhash); cited polars as user
6. **rust-planning/SKILL.md §5.6** — MSRV framing nuanced: optional for apps, with Zed-vs-nushell as contrasting examples
